```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
# This chunk runs first!
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# Load libraries HERE so they are available for all subsequent chunks
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(MASS)
library(car)
library(randtests)
# library(forecast)
```

Step 1: Loading in the Data

```{r}
# Packages used in tutorials
library(MASS)      # boxcox
library(car)       # qqPlot
library(randtests) # runs.test
# library(forecast) # OPTIONAL if you want auto.arima, not required

bike <- read.csv("trips_per_day.csv")
bike <- bike %>%
  filter(!is.na(trip_date))

bike$trip_date <- as.Date(bike$trip_date)

# Filter the bike dataframe to keep only trips from 2017 onwards
bike <- bike[bike$trip_date >= as.Date("2017-01-01"), ]

# Verify the new range
range(bike$trip_date)

str(bike)
head(bike)
range(bike$trip_date)

```
Initial Plotting for Time Series

```{r}
# Sort just in case
bike <- bike[order(bike$trip_date), ]

# Extract response as a vector
y <- bike$n_trips

# Daily frequency with yearly seasonality (approx 365)
bike_ts <- ts(
  y,
  start = c(as.numeric(format(min(bike$trip_date), "%Y")), 
            as.numeric(format(min(bike$trip_date), "%j"))),
  frequency = 365
)

plot(bike_ts, main = "Daily BikeShare Trips in Toronto", ylab = "Trips")

```

Step 2: EDA 

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
plot(bike_ts, main = "Daily Trips", ylab = "Trips")

# maybe a zoom on a couple of years
plot(window(bike_ts, start = c(2019, 1), end = c(2021, 365)),
     main = "Daily Trips: 2019–2021", ylab = "Trips")

```

```{r}
#trip_data <- read.csv("trips_per_day.csv") 
bike$trip_date <- as.Date(bike$trip_date)
bike$n_month <- as.numeric(format(bike$trip_date, "%m"))
bike$month <- factor(bike$n_month, levels = 1:12, labels = month.abb)
boxplot(n_trips ~ month, data = bike)
```


Confirming Seasonality with ACF and Spectrum

```{r}
acf(as.vector(bike_ts), lag.max = 400,
    main = "ACF of Daily Trips")
spec_bike <- spectrum(as.vector(bike_ts), spans = 5)
1 / spec_bike$freq[which.max(spec_bike$spec)]  # estimated period

```
Step 3: Box-Cox transformation 

```{r}
# Simple intercept-only model (like in tutorial)
bc_model_raw <- lm(bike_ts ~ 1)
boxcox_raw   <- MASS::boxcox(bc_model_raw, lambda = seq(-2, 2, 0.1))
(lambda_opt_raw <- boxcox_raw$x[which.max(boxcox_raw$y)])

```

```{r}
tim <- time(bike_ts)  # continuous time index

# Season: year and day-of-year or month; simplest is month
# Build a monthly factor from dates (instead of cycle, since this is daily)
month <- factor(format(bike$trip_date, "%m"))

reg_for_bc <- lm(bike_ts ~ tim + month)
boxcox_mod <- MASS::boxcox(reg_for_bc, lambda = seq(-2, 2, 0.1))
(lambda_opt_mod <- boxcox_mod$x[which.max(boxcox_mod$y)])

```
```{r}
lam <- lambda_opt_mod   # keep this for later

if (lam == 0) {
  y_trans <- log(bike_ts)
} else if (lam > 0) {
  y_trans <- (bike_ts^lam - 1) / lam
} else { 
  # negative lambda → use minus sign trick like in lectures
  y_trans <- -(bike_ts^lam)
}

plot(y_trans, main = "Transformed Daily Trips", ylab = "Transformed trips")

```
Classical Decomposition 
```{r}
Decomp_bike <- stl(y_trans, s.window = "periodic")
plot(Decomp_bike, main = "STL Decomposition of Transformed Daily Trips")

# Extract components if needed
bike_seasonal <- Decomp_bike$time.series[, "seasonal"]
bike_trend    <- Decomp_bike$time.series[, "trend"]
bike_remainder <- Decomp_bike$time.series[, "remainder"]

```
```{r}

# Time Index
tim <- time(bike_ts) 

# Seasonal Factors
month <- factor(format(bike$trip_date, "%m")) 
weekday_num <- as.numeric(format(bike$trip_date, "%u")) # 1=Mon, ..., 7=Sun
weekday <- factor(weekday_num)
is_weekend <- factor(ifelse(weekday_num >= 6, "Weekend", "Weekday"))

# Dataframe
model_data <- data.frame(
  y_trans = as.numeric(y_trans),
  tim = as.numeric(tim),
  month = month,
  weekday = weekday,
  is_weekend = is_weekend
)
